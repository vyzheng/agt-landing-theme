                    Ethan was interviewed by Dr. Vivian as part of Columbia's official alumni interview program. 
                    Nervous and self-effacing, he downplayed his incredible achievements and thought he had a slim shot‚Äîbut 
                    Dr. Vivian saw something more.

                            <p>As you may know, Columbia released its admission decisions a couple of days ago, and I am thrilled to inform you that <strong>I was accepted!</strong> On top of admission, Columbia also offered me a spot in their <strong>I.I. Rabi Scholar Program</strong> ‚Äî a research program where only around ten freshmen are <strong>hand-picked by professors</strong> to become Rabi Scholars.</p>
                            
                            <p>These students are <strong>awarded large amounts of funding</strong> to pursue their own research ideas, get individualized advising, and even get a lounge all to themselves! It seems as though this program is extremely well-tailored and effective in turning its scholars into very impressive scientists!</p>
                            
                            <p>Upon hearing about the perks and prestige of this program, as well as how much I have liked Columbia from the beginning, in my mind, pretty much nothing at all could top it. I was offered admission by a few other good schools as well, <strong>but nothing could out-compete Columbia's incredible offer!</strong></p>
                            
                            <p>So, because of this, I am excited to tell you that I have officially committed to Columbia as a Rabi Scholar in the class of 2023! I'm a Columbia Lion now! Roar lions roar!</p>
                            
                            <p><strong>I would like to take a second to express my appreciation:</strong> thank you so much for everything -- I couldn't have done it without you! I am sure that your kind words following our interview played an instrumental role in the outcome of my application, so thank you very much! I cannot emphasize my gratitude enough.</p>
