                        <p class="story-subtitle"><em>A <strong>Stanford-trained economist</strong> and <strong>award-winning teacher</strong></em></p>
                        
                        <p>I grew up in China and went to a public high school that had never sent a student to the Ivy League. With no roadmap, I read every book and chased down every lead until I figured it out.</p>

                        <p>I managed to get into Columbia, graduated with an honors degree, and went on to earn a PhD in Economics from <strong>Stanford</strong> — where I received the <strong>Centennial Teaching Award</strong>, the university's highest honor for teaching.</p>

                        <p>After Stanford, I joined <strong>TikTok</strong> — where I led XFN teams of 100+ to launch <em>Branded Mission</em>, the first crowdsourced influencer product, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/18/tiktoks-ad-product-gives-creators-opportunities-partner-marketers-branded-content/" target="_blank">featured in TechCrunch</a>. I was named <strong>MVP of the year</strong>.</p>

                        <p>At TikTok, I was surprised to learn that <strong>senior execs</strong> — anxious parents themselves — kept asking how to navigate elite college admissions.</p>

                        <div class="key-message">
                            <p>I wanted to give them strategies that actually worked — <strong>backed by data</strong>, and built to tap into each student's <strong>unfair advantage</strong>.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>To succeed today, you need to <strong>manage yourself like a product</strong> — with a strong personal brand, clear frameworks, and real product–market fit.</p>

                        <p>I learned this <strong>the hard way</strong> — through years of studying and teaching at Stanford, building at TikTok, and digging deep into the data.</p>

                        <p class="cta-line"> And I'm excited to share it with you.</p>
