                                I grew up in China. My high school had <strong>never sent anyone to the Ivy League</strong>. 
                                Through obsessive research, I became 1 of only <strong>7 students</strong> from my

                                I led the <strong>commercialization of TikTok’s</strong> most iconic product — the Hashtag Challenge. 
                                <strong>Featured in TechCrunch</strong>, it grew into a $X00 million revenue stream, and I was named MVP employee of the year.

                                But what surprised me most? Executives earning $1M+ kept asking me,

                                I realized successful people felt lost too. So I dove into the <strong>SFFA v. Harvard

                                Because I believe there are many ways to win — you just need to know the game.
