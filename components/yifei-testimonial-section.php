                        <p>Yifei holds a PhD in Economics from Caltech. He's the founder-CEO of a multimillion-dollar company and a former Engineering Director at Outreach. His wife is an Oracle engineer. They're <strong>high-achieving, deeply educated</strong> ‚Äî and proud parents to 5-year-old Guangyu.</p>
                        
                        <p>But when it came to planning Guangyu's long-term admissions path, they felt <strong>completely lost</strong>.</p>
                        
                        <p>Public or private school? Math Olympiads or piano? Early specialization or broad exploration?</p>
                        
                        <p>They'd grown up within the East Asian education system ‚Äî one with totally different rules, expectations, and timelines. The U.S. college admissions process felt like a <strong>black box</strong>. And between running a company and managing full-time tech careers, they didn't have time for trial and error.</p>
                        
                        <p>That's where <strong>Admissions Game Theory</strong> came in.</p>

                        <p>Dr. Vivian took my wife and me from <strong>total noobs</strong> about U.S. college admissions to being <strong>surprisingly well-informed</strong>. It was a one-stop shop for us. For the first time, we understood how elite colleges actually evaluate applications ‚Äî and how those ratings map to real admissions probabilities.</p>
                        
                        <p>Seeing how <strong>150,000 real Harvard applications</strong> are distributed across six admissions cycles gave us a huge sense of clarity. I especially loved the <strong>'grid search' idea</strong> ‚Äî evaluating all the possible extracurricular paths and finding the right balance between exploring broadly and focusing deeply. It gave us a concrete framework to co-create Guangyu's journey in a way that fits both his interests <em>and</em> the future landscape of AI.</p>
                        
                        <p>Even after finishing the course, they still revisit the tools and resources ‚Äî again and again.</p>
                        
                        <p>Honestly, the <strong>$699 for the flagship course</strong> was one of the <strong>highest-ROI purchases</strong> we've made as parents. I'd recommend it to any family who wants to shortcut the long learning curve of U.S. college admissions.</p>
