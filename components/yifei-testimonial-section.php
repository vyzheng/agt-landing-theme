                            <p>"Dr. Vivian took my wife and me from <strong>total noobs</strong> about U.S. college admissions to being <strong>surprisingly well-informed</strong>. It was a one-stop shop for us. For the first time, we understood how elite colleges actually evaluate applications ‚Äî and how those ratings map to real admissions probabilities.</p>
                            
                            <p>Seeing how <strong>150,000 real Harvard applications</strong> are distributed across six admissions cycles gave us a huge sense of clarity. I especially loved the <strong>'grid search' idea</strong> ‚Äî evaluating all the possible extracurricular paths and finding the right balance between exploring broadly and focusing deeply. It gave us a concrete framework to co-create Guangyu's journey in a way that fits both his interests <em>and</em> the future landscape of AI.</p>
                            
                            <p>Even after finishing the course, we still revisit the tools and resources ‚Äî again and again.</p>
                            
                            <p>Honestly, the <strong>$699 for the flagship course</strong> was one of the <strong>highest-ROI purchases</strong> we've made as parents. I'd recommend it to any family who wants to shortcut the long learning curve of U.S. college admissions."</p>
