        <!-- Ethan's Story -->
        <div class="story-block">
            <div class="story-header">
                <h3 class="story-tagline">You're more impressive than you think.</h3>
                <p class="story-subtagline"><em>Let's tell the world about it.</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="story-content">
                <p>Ethan was interviewed by Dr. Vivian as part of Columbia's official alumni interview program. Nervous and self-effacing, he downplayed his credentials â€” telling her that his regional Olympiad awards and single-digit transaction eBay store "weren't that impressive."</p>
                
                <p>But Dr. Vivian saw a future scholar in the making. She submitted the <strong>highest possible evaluation</strong>, along with a glowing recommendation that reconnected the dots across Ethan's resume â€” reframing his low-key achievements into a compelling narrative of intellectual curiosity, initiative, and research potential. She helped admissions officers see Ethan not just as he was â€” but as the kind of future research leader they actively want to admit.</p>
                
                <p>Weeks later, Ethan wasn't just accepted. He was offered a spot in Columbia's <strong>I.I. Rabi Scholars Program</strong>, a selective research track awarded to only ~10 incoming freshmen per year.</p>
                
                <div class="testimonial-quote">
                    <p class="quote-label">Here's what Ethan wrote after receiving the news:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"As you may know, Columbia released its admission decisions a couple of days ago, and I am thrilled to inform you that <strong>I was accepted!</strong> On top of admission, Columbia also offered me a spot in their <strong>I.I. Rabi Scholar Program</strong> â€” a research program where only around ten freshmen are hand-picked by professors to become Rabi Scholars.</p>
                        
                        <p>These students are awarded large amounts of funding to pursue their own research ideas, get individualized advising, and even get a lounge all to themselves! It seems as though this program is extremely well-tailored and effective in turning its scholars into very impressive scientists!</p>
                        
                        <p>Upon hearing about the perks and prestige of this program, as well as how much I have liked Columbia from the beginning, in my mind, pretty much nothing at all could top it. I was offered admission by a few other good schools as well, but nothing could out-compete Columbia's incredible offer!</p>
                        
                        <p>So, because of this, I am excited to tell you that I have officially committed to Columbia as a Rabi Scholar in the class of 2023! I'm a Columbia Lion now! Roar lions roar!</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>I would like to take a second to express my appreciation: thank you so much for everything -- I couldn't have done it without you!</strong> I am sure that your kind words following our interview played an instrumental role in the outcome of my application, so thank you very much! I cannot emphasize my gratitude enough."</p>

                <h3 class="story-tagline">Even a Caltech PhD and multimillionaire CEO felt lost.</h3>
                <p class="story-subtagline"><em>Until we brought Nobel-level economic research and 150,000 Harvard applications to the table.</em></p>
            </div>
            
            <div class="story-content">
                <p>Yifei holds a PhD in Economics from Caltech. He's the founder-CEO of a multimillion-dollar company and a former Engineering Director at Outreach. His wife is an Oracle engineer. They're high-achieving, deeply educated â€” and proud parents to 5-year-old Guangyu.</p>
                
                <p>But when it came to planning Guangyu's long-term admissions path, they felt completely lost.</p>
                
                <p>Public or private school? Math Olympiads or piano? Early specialization or broad exploration?</p>
                
                <p>They'd grown up within the East Asian education system â€” one with totally different rules, expectations, and timelines. The U.S. college admissions process felt like a black box. And between running a company and managing full-time tech careers, they didn't have time for trial and error.</p>
                
                <p>That's where <strong>Admissions Game Theory</strong> came in.</p>
                
                <div class="testimonial-quote">
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>"Dr. Vivian took my wife and me from total noobs about U.S. college admissions to being surprisingly well-informed. It was a one-stop shop for us. For the first time, we understood how elite colleges actually evaluate applications â€” and how those ratings map to real admissions probabilities.</p>
                        
                        <p>Seeing how 150,000 real Harvard applications are distributed across six admissions cycles gave us a huge sense of clarity. I especially loved the 'grid search' idea â€” evaluating all the possible extracurricular paths and finding the right balance between exploring broadly and focusing deeply. It gave us a concrete framework to co-create Guangyu's journey in a way that fits both his interests <em>and</em> the future landscape of AI."</p>

                <p>Even after finishing the course, they still revisit the tools and resources â€” again and again.</p>
                
                <p class="pricing-highlight">"Honestly, the <strong>$699 for the flagship course</strong> was one of the highest-ROI purchases we've made as parents. I'd recommend it to any family who wants to shortcut the long learning curve of U.S. college admissions."</p>
